## SDL2 Game Template - Windows only (for now)

This is a simple template for SDL2 projects, I got tired of always having to scaffold SDL2 directories and having to 
write Makefiles all the time, so this is why this repo exists.

## IMPORTANT

After you clone this repo, delete the .git hidden file from the repo. Then open your terminal and type <code>git init</code> to start a new local repo.

## Technologies Used

- C/C++
- Makefiles
- SDL2

## How to Use

- Clone this repo anywhere you want
- Open the command prompt in that directory 
- Type <code>make</code> and hit Enter
- Then type <code>make run</code> and hit Enter, the project should be running.

You can change the code in the <code>main.cpp</code> file in the <code>src</code> directory.
